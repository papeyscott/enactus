            <h2 class="text-white">WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <p class="text-white">Enactus is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring students to improve the world through entrepreneurial action. We provide a platform for teams of outstanding university students to create community development projects that put people’s own ingenuity and talents at the center of improving their livelihoods. Guided by educators and supported by business leaders, our students take the kind of entrepreneurial approach that empowers people to be a part of their own success. Our work transforms both the lives of the people we serve, and in turn, the lives of our students as they develop into more effective, values-driven leaders.<br>
Annually, over 1,300,000 people are impacted through Enactus projects implemented by over 72,000 Enactus students spread across 1,730 tertiary institutions in 36 countries. Although the Enactus global operations started in 1975 with its global Headquarters in the United States, the Nigerian operations, started in 2000 when a strategic decision was reached to extend the Enactus program to other parts of the world. Since its inception in Nigeria, the Enactus programme has grown from one campus in 2000 to over 30 campuses spread across 25 states of the federation with an annual average of 1500 active students. Each year, the Enactus network in Nigeria (consisting of these dynamic undergraduates, academic and business leaders) directly impact over 100 rural communites by implementing 150+ innovative developmental projects that we have seen to have great potentials to empower individuals, reposition businesses and transform communities across the country.<br>

Over time, we have seen how the Enactus programme has transformed otherwise ordinary undergraduates into courageous, innovative, dynamic, resourceful and purposeful change agents who are equipped with entrepreneurial and leadership skills and are now leading change either as employees or as succeeding entreprenuers across the different sectors of the Nigerian economy.<br>

Leveraging its national spread, expertise in community engagement, footprints in communities across the country and extensive project management abilities, Enactus Nigeria has successfully partnered with various corporate organisations to develop and implement programmes that enable the partner organisations to achieve their CSR and other organisational (business) goals across different states. Some of these organizations include, but not limited to: the US Embassy, KPMG, Sahara Group, ACA Foundation, Accenture, Interswitch, GTBank, FCMB, First Bank, Lekoil, SC Johnson, Midwestern Oil and Gas, ACT Foundation, SMEDAN, Bank of Industry (BOI), Seplat, Eko Hotels and Suites, UAC, AXA Mansard, Verve Nigeria, MTN Foundation, Coca-Cola Foundation, etc. <br>
Owing to these partnerships and some other critical factors, Enactus Nigeria has continued to inspire and mentor Nigerian Youths to be major contenders in international competitions. Our efforts have paid off now and again as the successive Enactus National Champion teams have made it to the Final Round of the prestigious Enactus World Cup 9 times out of 13 appearances in an international competition with competitors from European countries and the United States. Thus, we have continued to demonstrate that given the right motivation and support, the Nigerian youth can be globally competitive.<br>
